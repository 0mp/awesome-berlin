# Obtaining a drivers license

Like most official processes in Germany, obtaining a drivers license takes time and patience. There are
many steps involved and the process can be affected by a number of factors:
- Do you already have a drivers license?
- In which country (and possibly, which state) was your license issued?
- Is your previous drivers license still valid?
