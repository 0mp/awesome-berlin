# Obtaining a drivers license

Like most official processes in Germany, obtaining a drivers license takes time and patience. There are
many steps involved and the process can be affected by a number of factors:
- Do you already have a drivers license?
- In which country (and possibly, which state) was your license issued?
- Is your previous drivers license still valid?

## Drivers license tests

There are two tests you will have to take (depending on your current drivers license status/country/state):
- Theorie (i.e. written test)
- Practical (i.e. driving test)

The theorie test requires that you learn 1000 questions. 30 questions will be randomly selected for the test. There are 2-5 points associated with each question, depending on the importance of
the question. When you miss a question, the points associated with the question are tallied. **You must miss 10 points or less to pass.**

Here is a [sample driving test](http://osterberger.org/test.html). It's an old paper test. You will be taking a digital test. The questions shown here, however, are similar to the questions you will face
on the digital test.

When you sign up for a driving school (Fahrschule), you will almost certainly be given access to a smartphone app that will allow you to study the required 1000 questions. The questions will
appear identically to the way they will appear on the theorie test. There might be minor differences depending on the update status of the app you are using.
 
The theorie questions are updated every three months so it's best to study fast so you don't have to learn new questions. Although they are updated, most questions are updated somewhat
insignificantly.

## Translation of your current drivers license
Depending on where your current drivers license was issued, you may have to get it translated to German. / ADAC
