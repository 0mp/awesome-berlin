# Obtaining a drivers license

Like most official processes in Germany, obtaining a drivers license takes time and patience. There are
many steps involved and the process can be affected by a number of factors:
- Do you already have a drivers license?
- In which country (and possibly, which state) was your license issued?
- Is your previous drivers license still valid?

## Necessary tasks to complete BEFORE submitting your application at the Bürgeramt:

| Task          | Where         | Approx. Cost |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| Eye test | Any eye glasses store (e.g. Fielmann) | €7
